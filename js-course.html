    	<h2 class="mt-5 mt-b">Requirements</h2>
    	<ul>
    		<li>No coding experience is necessary to take this course! I take you from beginner to expert!</li>
        <li>Any computer and OS will work â€” Windows, macOS or Linux. We will set up your text editor the course.</li>

    	<h2>Description</h2>
         <ul>
         	<li>"Really, really well made course. Super in-depth, with great challenges and projects that will solidify your Javascript understanding. I found the lectures were paced perfectly -- Jonas doesn't skip over anything that might be useful to a JS developer"</li>
         	<li>JavaScript is the most popular programming language in the world. It powers the entire modern web. It provides millions of high-paying jobs all over the world.</li>
         	<li>That's why you want to learn JavaScript too. And you came to the right place!</li>
         </ul>
       </section>
       <section class="container">
         	 <h2>Why is this the right JavaScript course for you?</h2>
           <ul>
           	<li>This is the most complete JavaScript course on Udemy. It's an all-in-one package that will take you from the very fundamentals of JavaScript, all the way to building modern and complex applications</li>
           	<li>You will learn modern JavaScript from the very beginning, step-by-step. I will guide you through practical and fun code examples, important theory about how JavaScript works behind the scenes, and beautiful and complete projects.</li>
            <li>You will also learn how to think like a developer, how to plan application features, how to architect your code, how to debug code, and a lot of other real-world skills that you will need on your developer job.</li>
            <li>And unlike other courses, this one actually contains beginner, intermediate, advanced, and even expert topics, so you don't have to buy any other course in order to master JavaScript from the ground up!</li>
            <li>But... You don't have to go into all these topics. This is a huge course, because, after all, it's "The Complete JavaScript Course". In fact, it's like many courses in one! But you can become an excellent developer by watching only parts of the course. That's why I built this course in a very modular way, and designed pathways that will take you through the course faster.</li>
            <li>By the end of the course, you will have the knowledge and confidence that you need in order to ace your job interviews and become a professional developer.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="mt-5">So what exactly is covered in the course?</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Build 5 beautiful real-world projects for your portfolio! In these projects, you will learn how to plan and architect your applications using flowcharts and common JavaScript patterns</li>
              <li>Master the JavaScript fundamentals: variables, if/else, operators, boolean logic, functions, arrays, objects, loops, strings, and more</li>
              <li>Learn modern JavaScript (ES6+) from the beginning: arrow functions, destructuring, spread operator, default arguments, optional chaining (ES2020), and more</li>
              <li>Deep dive into asynchronous JavaScript: the event loop, promises, async/await, and error handling. You will use these to access data from third-party APIs with AJAX calls. [This is like a small standalone course]</li>
              <li>Learn modern tools that are used by professional web developers: NPM, Parcel (module bundler), Babel, and ES6 modules</li>
            </ul>
